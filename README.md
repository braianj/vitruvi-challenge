# Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Exercise: Task tracker   
Please develop a SPA with this simple requirements:   
* Present visually a list of tasks in 3 different states: Planned, In progress, Completed.   
* Each task contains, name, description, estimate and state.   
* The user needs to be able to add/remove and change the state of the tasks.  
* Somewhere in the application you need to present an up to date status, adding up all hours for each state.  
Notes:   
You can assume it's a single user application, and there's no need to store data; but the user needs to be able to add/remove and see tasks.  

Mocking a REST api is suggested.   
You can reuse any existing library, but please distribute the solution with them.   
Write code as you would for production, having in mind that usability is important as well.   

Use React JS, React Native or Angular 2+

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

For this project I used Redux Saga and Typescript. For the UI part I used a bootstrap for React.
